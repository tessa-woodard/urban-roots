              Plants are trending, we know... and they add so much to the vibe
              of a space! But when you embellish interior spaces with
              houseplants, youâ€™re not just adding greenery. These living
              organisms interact with your body, mind and home in ways that can
              enhance your quality of life. For starters, they help to improve
              the quality of indoor air, and studies have also shown that being
              around plants improves concentration, memory and productivity.
